# Project-2

Per the instructions page, inside Your README.md:
1. Include User Stories
2. Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
3. Have a link to your hosted working app.

Project Choice (Tell us which project you're doing!): Ollivanders
Project Description
Include: Inspired by Harry Potter, a shop inventory for Ollivanderâ€™s wands.

General App Idea/Purpose: The app serves as a shopkeeper's inventory of Ollivander's wands with relevant information about each wand. Specifically, the quantity of wands in stock, wands' component information (wood and feather-type), price and who the wands are sold to.

Models including field names and their datatypes:

const wandsSchema = Schema({
wood: {type: String, required: true},
feather: {type: String, required: true},
image: String,
price: { type: Number, minimum: 0},
qty: { type: Number, minimum: 0}
})


> A list of routes (e.g. `POST /pins/ allows users to post a picture of a pin`)
1. GET; /wands; Index page; List of wands
2. GET; /wands/:id; Show page; Information for 1 wand
3. GET; /wands/new; New page; Add new wand to inventory
4. POST; /wands; Create page; Create wand on server
5. GET; /wands/:id/edit; Edit page; Get form already filled in for user to change
6. PUT/PATCH; /wands/:id; update; update wand 's data on server
7. DELETE; /wands/:id; destroy; removes wand from server

User Stories

MVP Goals
User stories detailing app functionality
Add user stories following the As a [type of user], I want [what the user wants], so that [what it helps accomplish] format.

As a wand-shop owner, I want to have an index of all of my wand wood-types and their stock status, so that I can see easily what wands are available for sale and whether I need to construct more.

As a wand-shop owner, I want to have a page showing each wand's information, including wood-type, feather-type, wand quantity in stock, price and who I've sold the wand to because knowing this information is critical to do business.

As a wand-shop owner, I want to have a page to add a new wand type to my inventory so that I can have the ability to account for new wands that I construct to restock my supply.

As a wand-shop owner, I want to have a page where I can edit details for each wand so that I can correct any mistakes or mark a wand as sold.

Stretch Goals
-Use EJS Partials
-Include portfolio-quality styling

//The instructions for project 2 say nothing about whether the seeding of databases is required for our project. Is seeding required? Not required for this project.

//I reviewed the class video for seeding databases from week 12 (8/13).
    //the purpose of seeding data is pushing additional array objects into an array that lives in a database, correct? The most common case when we're moving to the cloud infrastructure, for example, from a physical database.
//For project 2, do I have to have my array of objects in two places? Is the first place in my models and the second place a database using mongo?
        //Yes. Get the atlas account set up.
    //am I copying and pasting from my wands.js model file into my terminal or am I going to use my terminal to grab the array from my wands.js file? It feels like i'm duplicating my work.

//INTERNAL ROUTES
// app.use("/wands/seed", (req, res)=>{
//     Wand.create([])
// })
