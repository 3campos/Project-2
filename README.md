# Project-2

Per the instructions page, inside Your README.md:
1. Include User Stories
2. Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
3. Have a link to your hosted working app.

Project Choice (Tell us which project you're doing!): Ollivanders
Project Description
Include: Inspired by Harry Potter, a shop inventory for Ollivanderâ€™s wands.

General App Idea/Purpose: The app serves as a shopkeeper's inventory of Ollivander's wands with relevant information about each wand. Specifically, the quantity of wands in stock, wands' component information (wood and feather-type), price and who the wands are sold to.

Models including field names and their datatypes:

const wandsSchema = Schema({
wood: {type: String, required: true},
feather: {type: String, required: true},
image: String,
price: { type: Number, minimum: 0},
qty: { type: Number, minimum: 0}
})

User Stories

MVP Goals
User stories detailing app functionality
Add user stories following the As a [type of user], I want [what the user wants], so that [what it helps accomplish] format.

As a wand-shop owner, I want to have an index of all of my wand wood-types and their stock status, so that I can see easily what wands are available for sale and whether I need to construct more.
As a wand-shop owner, I want to have a page showing each wand's information, including wood-type, feather-type, wand quantity in stock, price and who I've sold the wand to because knowing this information is critical to do business.
As a wand-shop owner, I want to have a page to add a new wand type to my inventory so that I can have the ability to account for new wands that I construct to restock my supply.
As a wand-shop owner, I want to have a page where I can edit details for each wand so that I can correct any mistakes or mark a wand as sold.
