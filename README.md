# Project-2

Per the instructions page, inside Your README.md:
1. Include User Stories
2. Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
3. Have a link to your hosted working app.

Project Choice (Tell us which project you're doing!): Ollivanders
Project Description
Include: Inspired by Harry Potter, a shop inventory for Ollivanderâ€™s wands.

General App Idea/Purpose: The app serves as a shopkeeper's inventory of Ollivander's wands with relevant information about each wand. Specifically, the quantity of wands in stock, wands' component information (wood and feather-type), price and who the wands are sold to.

Models including field names and their datatypes:

const wandsSchema = Schema({
wood: {type: String, required: true},
feather: {type: String, required: true},
image: String,
price: { type: Number, minimum: 0},
qty: { type: Number, minimum: 0}
})


> A list of routes (e.g. `POST /pins/ allows users to post a picture of a pin`)
1. GET; /wands; Index page; List of wands
2. GET; /wands/:id; Show page; Information for 1 wand
3. GET; /wands/new; New page; Add new wand to inventory
4. POST; /wands; Create page; Create wand on server
5. GET; /wands/:id/edit; Edit page; Get form already filled in for user to change
6. PUT/PATCH; /wands/:id; update; update wand 's data on server
7. DELETE; /wands/:id; destroy; removes wand from server

User Stories

MVP Goals
User stories detailing app functionality
Add user stories following the As a [type of user], I want [what the user wants], so that [what it helps accomplish] format.

As a wand-shop owner, I want to have an index of all of my wand wood-types and their stock status, so that I can see easily what wands are available for sale and whether I need to construct more.

As a wand-shop owner, I want to have a page showing each wand's information, including wood-type, feather-type, wand quantity in stock, price and who I've sold the wand to because knowing this information is critical to do business.

As a wand-shop owner, I want to have a page to add a new wand type to my inventory so that I can have the ability to account for new wands that I construct to restock my supply.

As a wand-shop owner, I want to have a page where I can edit details for each wand so that I can correct any mistakes or mark a wand as sold.

Stretch Goals
-Use EJS Partials
-Include portfolio-quality styling

When done, do: git push heroku main

To see all errors and push history to heroku, run:

Extra notes:
1. I used node.js, mongoose, express and ejs.
2. I started by installing all of my packages and everything else needed for all listed in #1.
    2a. I then found images and researched information about wands (their components and owners) from Harry Potter. This the website that I used primarily for my project: https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wand
    2b. At first, I built and used a local database for the first few days of my project. After discussing this with an instructor, I modified my project (altering methods and route code blocks as needed) so that I could utilize an online database on Atlas. This was accomplished after multiple days of researching and rewatching previous lessons, and critical assistance from IA's and instructors.
    2c. I seeded my database successfully using this site provided by an IA as a resource: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/seeding-mongodb-database-from-node-the-simplest-way-3d6a0c1c4668
    2e. After I connected my database to atlas, I completed my routes and cleaned up my ejs files to include buttons for the user's ease of navigability. 
    2f. I then deployed to heroku successfully.
    2g. I applied css to my file.
3. Unsolved problems: None.
4. Notes to self: see pseucode in server.js.
